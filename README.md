# Diabetes Prediction and Food Recommendation using AI
This project integrates machine learning and AI to support personalized diabetes management and health improvement through data-driven insights and food recommendations. By predicting diabetes status from patient health data, the system offers tailored health advice. Using these predictions, it suggests traditional foods appropriate for various stages of diabetes and provides health insights based on selected foods. Additionally, a computer vision component with OCR detects nutritional information from food labels, allowing AI to offer real-time health guidance based on nutritional content. Together, these components provide a comprehensive, personalized approach to diabetes care and dietary management.

## Description
### 1. **Diabetes Prediction**  
   Apply machine learning to predict a patient’s diabetes status based on their health data and use AI to generate tailored health insights and recommendations accordingly.

### 2. **Food Recommendation**  
   Use machine learning to provide food recommendations based on diabetes prediction results and health data, focusing on traditional foods suitable for individuals at various stages of diabetes. Additionally, use AI to generate health insights based on the selected foods.

### 3. **Computer Vision AI Food Recommendation**  
   Utilize computer vision with OCR technology to detect nutritional information from food labels, enabling AI to generate health insights and personalized advice based on the nutritional composition of the food.

## Getting Started
## Dependencies
To set up the project environment, make sure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. Use the following command to install everything from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing API Keys Setup
### 1. **API Keys Setup**
  To use the AI functionalities in the project, create a .env file in the project’s root directory. This file should store your API keys in the following format:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  GEMINI_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_ai_api_key
  ```
  Replace your_openai_api_key and your_gemini_ai_api_key with your actual OpenAI and Gemini API keys.

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
  Having this .env file is essential, as it allows secure access to the AI services within the project.

## Executing program
Once dependencies and API keys are set up, follow these steps to run and interact with the project:

### 1. **Launch the Application**
  Run the main Streamlit application file by executing:
```
streamlit run streamlit_code.py
```
### 2. **Access the Prediction Page**
  On the first page, input the relevant health data, including glucose levels, blood pressure, weight, height, age, and gender for diabetes assessment.
